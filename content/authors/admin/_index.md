I am a political scientist at the Department of Political Science (IfPol) of the University of Münster. My main area of research is comparative politics with an interest in democratization, political parties, political behavior and populism. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Salzburg for my dissertation entitled "Dissatisfied democrats? How citizens' policy discontent and conceptions of democracy relate to support for populist parties".
