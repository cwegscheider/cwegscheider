abstract: Alongside citizens’ belief in the legitimacy of democracy, public
  support for the political regime is crucial to the survival of (democratic)
  political systems. Yet, we know fairly little about the relationship between
  citizens’ democratic knowledge and their evaluation of democratic performance
  from a global comparative perspective. In this article, we argue that the
  cognitive ability of citizens to distinguish between democratic and
  authoritarian characteristics constitutes the individual yardstick for
  assessing democracy in practice. Furthermore, we expect that the effect of
  citizens’ democratic knowledge on their evaluation of democratic performance
  is moderated by the institutional level of democracy. We test these
  assumptions by combining data from the sixth and seventh wave of the World
  Values Survey and the third pre-release of the European Values Study 2017,
  resulting in 114 representative samples from 80 countries with 128,127
  respondents. Applying multilevel regression modeling, we find that the higher
  a country’s level of democracy, the more positive the effect of democratic
  knowledge on citizens’ assessment of democratic performance. In contrast, we
  find that the lower the level of democracy in a country, the more negative the
  effect of citizens’ democratic knowledge on their evaluation of democracy.
  Thus, this study shows that citizens who are more knowledgeable about
  democracy are most cognitively able to assess the level of democracy in line
  with country-level measures of democracy. These results open up new
  theoretical and empirical perspectives for related research on support for and
  satisfaction with democracy as well as research on democratization.
