abstract: "In this article, we aim to disentangle the extent to which citizens’
  conceptions of democratic decision-making are shaped by populist attitudes or
  rather by radical left and right host ideologies. Following recent work by
  Landwehr and Steiner (2017), we distinguish four modes of decision-making
  embedded in different conceptions of democracy: trusteeship democracy,
  anti-pluralism, deliberative proceduralism, and majoritarianism. Drawing on
  data from Austria and Germany, we show that populism and radical host
  ideologies tap into different dimensions of democracy. While populism is
  primarily directed against representative forms of democratic decision-making,
  preferences for deliberative procedures and majority decisions appear entirely
  shaped by radical left and right host ideologies. Populism thus views
  decision-making based on the general will of the people as the only legitimate
  democratic procedure, whereas radical left and right host ideologies aim at
  involving the relevant group(s) of citizens. Further analyses of the
  interactions between populist attitudes and radical host ideologies confirm
  that the effects of populism remain robust and thus independent of the
  specific manifestations of radical host ideologies. These findings help to
  disentangle the causes of democratic discontent and to develop possible
  responses through democratic reforms that specifically and separately aim to
  mitigate populism and radical host ideologies."
